# Plant-Disease-Detection

### Project Details
This application serves as a powerful tool for detecting and diagnosing various diseases in plants. By leveraging advanced image recognition and deep learning models, such as MobileNetV2, the app enables accurate identification of plant diseases based on visual symptoms. Farmers, gardeners, and agricultural professionals can capture images of plants, and the app will analyze the photos to detect any diseases, offering timely insights and potential solutions. With a large dataset of over 70,000 images used for training, the app ensures a high degree of accuracy in identifying a wide range of plant diseases. It empowers users to take preventative and corrective actions to maintain healthy crops, ultimately contributing to improved agricultural productivity and plant health management.
